# waveform_processing_for_imagej
ImageJ plugins for analyzing and processing ultrasound waveforms.  I use them for processing ultrasound waveforms, but they can be used with any type of uniformly sampled, time-varying signals.

Installation: Add the jar file to the ImageJ plugins folder and restart ImageJ (note that this library now depends on the Apache Commons Math v3.6.1 and Apache Commons Lang v3.4 libraries, so those should go in your plugins folder, too).  The plugins will then be available in the Plugins menu.

Note: this is a "maven-ized" replacement for the "Waveform-Analysis-for-ImageJ" repository, which has been deprecated.
