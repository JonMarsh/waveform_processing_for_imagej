# waveform_processing_for_imagej
ImageJ plugins for analyzing and processing ultrasound waveforms.  I use them for processing ultrasound waveforms, but they can be used with any type of time-varying signals.

Installation: Just add the jar file to the ImageJ plugins folder and restart ImageJ; the plugins will then be available in the Plugins menu.

Note: this is a "maven-ized" replacement for the "Waveform-Analysis-for-ImageJ" repository.
